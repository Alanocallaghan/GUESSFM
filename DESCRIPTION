Package: GUESSFM
Title: Using GUESS for Fine Mapping
Description: GUESS is software to search for the best sets of multiple SNP
    models in a given dataset using MCMC.  GUESSFM has some functions to help
    run GUESS in a fine mapping setting.  Note also the package R2GUESS which
    helps directly run GUESS and evaluate its output.  GUESSFM is intended to
    be complementary to R2GUESS rather supercede any of its functionality.
