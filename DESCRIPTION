Package: GUESSFM
Title: Using GUESS for Fine Mapping
Description: GUESS is software to search for the best sets of multiple SNP
    models in a given dataset using MCMC.  GUESSFM has some functions to help
    run GUESS in a fine mapping framework.  Note also R2GUESS which helps
    directly run GUESS and evaluate its output.  GUESSFM is intended to be
    complementary to R2GUESS rather supercede any of its functionality.
